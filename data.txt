Once upon a time, in a warm and sunny place, there was a big pit. A little boy named Tom liked to play near the pit. One day, Tom lost his red ball. He was very sad.
Sam and Tom went close to the pit. They were scared, but they wanted to find the red ball. They looked into the pit, but it was too dark to see. Tom said, "We must go in and search for my ball."
